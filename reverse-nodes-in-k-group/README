The ktail variable wasn't set before, now it points to the tail of the reversed set of k nodes.

Again, we found 2 more does to reverse.

  ktail     head 

At the above point, we need to connect the previous set of reversed k nodes and the current set. We set the ktail next pointer to revHead and set the ktail to point to head.
